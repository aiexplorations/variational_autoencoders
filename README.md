# Variational Autoencoder using Keras

This is just a working replica of the code presented in the below very handy walkthrough, on the official Keras blog.

The result/output from this in the form of a sample `png` image is available in the repo.

This is my first step along the way to learning and appreciating autoencoder networks.
